Description: Table one is a tabular description of
    characteristics, e.g., demographics of patients in a clinical trial,
    presented overall and also stratified by a categorical variable, e.g.
    treatment group.  There are many excellent packages available to
    create table one.  This package focuses on providing table one objects
    that seamlessly fit into 'R Markdown' analyses.
